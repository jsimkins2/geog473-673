# Machine Learning with R



Machine Learning is data science technique where we predict results based on incoming data. Various tasks for machine learning include data concepts learning, data function learning, or predictive modeling which involves the identification of predictive patterns. Each of these tasks are learned from an initial dataset. Algorithms, or simply R code with a purpose, can be used to observe patterns, trends, experiences, and/or instructions from this initial dataset. The goal of machine learning is to use these initial instructions to create advanced insights and ultimately future learning improvements of it's own dataset. As humans, we're constantly undergoing subconscious machine learning. We recognize patterns in our daily lives and use this data to form a more accurate analysis or form a better prediction model for ourselves. 

Let's explain machine learning with an example regarding mathematics in school. Students in math classes are often given practice problems to train their mathematic ability. Often times, a math concept is taught to the students and then students use this concept to help solve practice problems. Let's assume that for this example, *the math concept is not taught*. Instead, only practice problems and their associated answers are given. Each practice problem encodes pieces of information that a student observes alongside the answer. We can call this learning process the training of an algorithm. After many practice problems, we expect that the students would have identified a pattern they can use to help solve the problem. So a test is given to the student and we compare their results to the answer key. Evaluating the accuracy of the students answers gives us a measure of effectiveness for both the student and the set of practice problems. To summarize, machine learning algorithms are like math students who have been given vast amounts of practice problems and instructed to find methods for solving them by finding patterns between the math problems and their assoicated answers. Machine Learning aims to understand the concepts or the formulas behind datasets. Computers are much better at crunching numbers than us and this is why we use machine learning.
