- Phase 1: Advanced R for Geospatial Sciences - 02/15/2021 - 04/16/2021 – 2cr

- Phase 2: Machine Learning with R – 04/19/2021 to 05/18/2021 – 1cr


The objective of the spring installment of GEOG 473/673 is to expand on the topics covered in the fall version of GEOG 473/673 – open source environmental computing. The course will be split into 2 phases. The first phase is a 2-credit course focused on using advanced tools within the R programming language. The goal of this phase is for students to gain practical experience with challenging R topics that can be used for generating publication quality material. The second phase is a 1-credit course focused on introducing machine learning practices and implementing these via R. Machine Learning is a growing practice in data science and can be useful for geospatial sciences. Students will apply R programming knowledge and gain confidence in machine learning techniques and application with R. This challenging, fast-paced course is intended for students that already have programming experience with R or Python.
