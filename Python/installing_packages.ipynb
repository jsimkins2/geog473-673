    "### Environments\n",
    "- Environments are a collection of packages designed to work together. Imagine a Jungle environment, an Arctic Tundra environment, a Desert environment, etc. \n",
    "- Environments are separate from each other and packages installed in one environment are not installed in another unless we explicitly tell Python to do that. \n",
    "- They contain certain **versions** of packages that other packages require. \n",
    "- Often times a higher level package will require specific versions of basic lower level packages.\n",
    "- MetPy 0.11.1 might work with numPy 2.2.12, but might not work with numPy 2.2.13. We must pay close attention to this.\n",
    "- Environments can also be used to contain different versions of Python (3.8, 3.7, etc.)\n",
    "- It's always a good idea to create a new environment if you're nervous a unique package might disrupt an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages/Modules/Libraries \n",
    "- Packages are pre-written functions people have written for the benefit of all Python users.\n",
    "- We import packages to tell Python we want to use some functions that exist within that package.\n",
    "- Packages **must be installed** before they can be imported \n",
    "- Python will get confused and will not run if you attempt to use a function without loading in the package.\n",
    "- A package is a toolbox. A function is the tool within the toolbox.\n",
    "- Imagine we import the `wrench-toolbox` package to use the `small-wrench` function\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Rules\n",
    "- When you install a new package, new packages will be downloaded. Sometimes existing packages will be upgraded, and sometimes they'll be **downgraded**. **Downgrading can cause real issues between packages**. If this happens, create a new environment and install the new package *first*. *Note that if the 'downgraded' packages are 'anaconda' or 'conda' related packages, these likely won't hurt any packages you already have installed. You can ignore these related packages and proceed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes you'll see packages being **SUPERSEDED BY HIGHER PRIORITY CHANNEL**. All this means is that anaconda recognizes you're downloading certain packages from a source that isn't as high on the priority list as another one. This doesn't normally cause any issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `conda install -c conda-forge cartopy` vs. `conda install -c cartopy` is an example of two different \"Channels\" that you can download the `cartopy` library from. Conda-forge is very high on the priority list and is often considered equal to just plain old anaconda channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Installs for this class\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MetPy** - `conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 metpy`\n",
    "- **Cartopy** - `conda install -c conda-forge cartopy`\n",
    "- **netcdf4** - `conda install -c anaconda netcdf4`\n",
    "- **pytest** - `conda install -c anaconda pytest`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Installing MetPy alone will install ~95% of the other packages we will need*"
