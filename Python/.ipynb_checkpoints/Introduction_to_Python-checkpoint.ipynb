    "# Welcome to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open-source (aka free to use and develop) programming language used in many professional fields ranging from climate modeling to geospatial analysis to tracking citi-bike usage in NYC. Where there's a will to do something in Python, there is a way. It's quickly grown into one of the world's most popular programming languages, especially in the scientific fields. Currently, Python is the 3rd most popular programming language in the world: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class, we'll be using the Anaconda Distribution of Python. Anaconda is a python and R distribution. It aims to provide everything you need (python wise) for data science \"out of the box\". You'll need to find Anaconda Navigator that's installed on your computer. Within this, we can select different IDE's (Integrated development environments) for Python which are just different ways to visualize Python programming and make it more human readable. Within Anaconda Navigator, you'll notice a few different options, but familiarize yourself with the Environment's tab and the Spyder IDE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda also maintains other Python services such as the Anaconda navigator (just a central location for your Python stuff) and has it's own IDE called Spyder, which we will be using in this class. What you're looking at on Github right now is called a Jupyter Notebook, and it's just Python code that is written and run out of cells. The output is displayed below the cells. You can think of Jupyter Notebook as the cousin of a Python IDE such as Spyder. Both execute Python code, but display it in different ways. Spyder is set up similar to R. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python is not R\n",
    "Python programming logic is very similar to R, although the syntax is different amongst a few other things to note;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has no RStudio. In other words, there is no single IDE (integrated development environment) that runs the show here. There are 10-100 different IDE's for Python. Their sole purpose is to make Python programming more human readable and intuitive. Unfortunately, there is no IDE as good as RStudio...Once again, we'll be using Spyder in this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python modules (aka packages) do not play nicely together all the time. In R, we could install whatever modules we wanted to at all times and they would all play nicely. Python is more like the wild west, there are more modules available for more purposes, but they have different dependencies (aka other packages they depend on to run properly). For example, you may want to use the 'basemap' module and the 'cartopy' module together in one script and for each of these modules, the JPEG module is a dependency - it needs JPEG to run. However, 'basemap' requires JPEG version 7.7, whereas 'cartopy' requires JPEG version 8.1. This creates some big headaches, and we need to be careful about which module/package is installed where. In order to work around this, we have different environments for different sets of packages. An environment is just a sandbox that doesn't know about packages/modules in another sandbox. We can have an environment called 'environment 1' where 'basemap' and 'JPEG version 7.7' are installed. We can have another environment called 'environment 2' where 'cartopy' and 'JPEG version 8.1' are installed. At the beginning of our Python session, we will have to source the environment we want should we want to use a specific one, otherwise the standard Base environment is loaded in. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is the programming language, but a few different services have been created to install what we want/need to do what we want in Python. These services are known as anaconda & pip. These are installers that can be used to download python packages from the web and install them in the environment of your choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python only uses '=' to declare an object whereas R could use both '=' and '<-'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both R and Python use the '#' symbol to indicate a comment within the code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python 2 vs 3\n",
    "Differences in coding are relatively minor but can create issues.\n",
    "- Version 2.7 remains heavily used, but support for it is _rapidly_ being deprecated.\n",
    "    - How much time is left? [Python 2.7 Retirement Count Down](https://pythonclock.org/)\n",
    "- **Version 3.5**, or higher, is what you should be using.\n",
