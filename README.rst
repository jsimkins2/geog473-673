GEOG 473/673: Advanced R for Spatial Analysis and Visualization
============================================================
 Pearson 203 – MW 8:40 – 9:55

Phase 1: Spatial Analysis & Visualization in R - 02/15/2021 - 04/16/2021 – 2cr

Phase 2: Machine Learning in R – 4/19/2021 to 5/18/2021 – 1cr


The objective of the Spring installment of GEOG 473/673 is to expand on the topics covered in the Fall version of GEOG 473/673 (Intro to R, sections 2-9 of this book). The course will be split into 2 phases. The first phase is a 2-credit course focused on using advanced tools within the R programming language (sections 10-16 of this book). The goal of this phase is for students to gain practical experience with challenging R topics that can be used for generating publication quality material. The second phase is a 1-credit course focused on introducing machine learning practices and implementing these via R (sections 17-19 of this book). Machine Learning is a growing practice in data science and can be useful for geospatial sciences. Students will apply R programming knowledge and gain confidence in machine learning techniques and application with R. This challenging, fast-paced course is intended for students that already have programming experience with R or Python.
