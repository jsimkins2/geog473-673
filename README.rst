Welcome to what is going to be a very novel workshop like course. This course will be a series of brief lectures followed by a real-world geospatial data problem or task that will be solved using R & Python. It is designed to be very hands-on and involved as coding in this manner is a skill that needs to be practiced, rather than a theory that needs to be learned. Collaborative coding and team-based problem solving will be a large feature of this course as this is how R & Python scientific programmers perform at a high level.
