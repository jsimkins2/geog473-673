## What is R?






## Installing and Using Packages

To use a function in R that performs a task (such as plotting, statistical analysis, etc.), we must first load the package into our R session. When we use Microsoft Excel, nearly all the functions you can use with it are available in the toolbar at the top of the page. In R, however, you'll need to load in the packages you'd like to use. Once the package is loaded, R will recognize any functions you call that are part of that package. 

In R, the package is the toolbox; the function is the tool. We need to load the woodworking toolbox in order to use the hammer.

Most of the packages you'll want to use are not previously installed on R. You'll need to install them onto your local machine. Once they are installed once, you shouldn't have to worry about installing them again. Here's how you install the `ggplot2` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Paste this code into your **console**. Then hit enter and watch R run your code to install the packages!

If R console returns with a question like, "Would you like to install from source? Yes / No" - answer with **Yes**. These packages we're downloading contain pre-written code that other developers have created so we don't have to recreate the wheel. Source is a location where the package is stored - it's the initial location it was created, in fact. Think of the package download location as a Car Dealership - all car dealerships sell the same thing, but they all have different cars in different colors from different years. When we select source, we select a car directly from the manufacturer. 

## Loading the installed packages into R

Here's the code we use to load a package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

You may be wondering, why do I need to load in the packages I want to use? R is designed to be *fast*. If you were to pre-load every single package available in R, you'd be loading thousands and thousands of packages. We can keep R light and fast by only loading the specific "toolboxes" we need. 

Now that the `ggplot2` package is installed, we can use any function that is within that package. If you're curious about what functions are in a particular package, [most packages have thorough documentation and examples online](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/). 

## Running Code

In R, there are multiple ways to run code. Remember that we write code in an R Script and run that code in the console. We can execute code in the following ways:

1) Click 'Run' at the top of the R script. Note that yours may not look the exact same, but just find a `Run` button to click!


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/runRcode.png")  
```

  - This option allows you to run sections of your code, line by line, or the whole script.

2) While the cursor is on a line of code you want to run in the R script, Hit `Ctrl + Enter` on Windows, `Cmd + Enter` on Mac. This will run that line of code.

3) Select and highlight the section of code you want to run in the R script, Hit `Ctrl + Enter` on Windows, `Cmd + Enter` on Mac.This will run that selected section of code.

4) As you become more advanced, you'll be able to write a script in RStudio and then run the entire script on your computer without opening it again. We won't touch this in this workshop, but it's straight-forward once you get the hang of it.
