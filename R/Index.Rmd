This textbook provides R programming tutorials for geospatial sciences. These were built for University of Delaware Department of Geography and Spatial Sciences 473/673 course. This is a complete manual covering ~ 4 credits of material designed to take a student with little to no R coding experience to proficient in R for geospatial sciences. Data ingest, quality control, reprojection, publication quality visualization, and machine learning techniques are all covered in this book with a focus on spatial datasets. 

The objective of the Spring installment of GEOG 473/673 is to expand on the topics covered in the Fall version of GEOG 473/673 (Open-source Environmental Computing, sections 2-9 of this book). The course will be split into 2 phases. The first phase is a 2-credit course focused on using advanced tools within the R programming language (sections 10-16 of this book). The goal of this phase is for students to gain practical experience with challenging R topics that can be used for generating publication quality material. The second phase is a 1-credit course focused on introducing machine learning practices and implementing these via R (sections 17-19 of this book). Machine Learning is a growing practice in data science and can be useful for geospatial sciences. Students will apply R programming knowledge and gain confidence in machine learning techniques and application with R. This challenging, fast-paced course is intended for students that already have programming experience with R or Python. If you're coming into this course without any R experience, you are encouraged to visit sections 2-9 of this book for introductory guidance with R.
